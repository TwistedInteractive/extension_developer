Create Symphony extensions with ease

## Wait, what?

That's right! Now **you too** can create awesome Symphony extensions and lift the platform to new heights! This utility
creates a boilerplate for you according to your custom preferences.

## But I'm not good at creating extensions

That's another reason why this utility is the right thing for you! It gives you a well-documented boilerplate extension
to work with, and easy to setup:

 - Enter preferences like name, version and your (author) details.
 - Select the type of extension you want to create and fill in additional wishes (for example, when creating a new type of field).
 - Select which delegates you want to use, just by ticking the box. Well-documented code will be generated, _including_ what parameters to expect in the `$context`-parameter.
 - Need a content page in your extension? Just tick the box!
 - Need javascript and css in the backend for your extension? Just tick the box!

These are just some of the many features this tool brings to you! Just try it out!

 ## But I am already a great extension developer, why should I care?

 Same reasons as above. Create a boilerplate in a jiffy and work from there!
